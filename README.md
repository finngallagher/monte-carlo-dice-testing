# monte-carlo-dice-testing
Basic R shiny app to demonstrate monte carlo testing on weighted dice.
This program allows a user to simulate a weighted dice by adjusting the weights of individual faces. The app will then perform a chosen number of monte carlo simulations and provide a histogram of p-values. The program also allows the users to chose a test statistic from a list of options.
This app was designed to help give a visual understanding to students first encountering monte carlo testing and its limitations.
